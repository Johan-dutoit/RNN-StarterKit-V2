# RNN-StarterKit-V2
A starter kit for [React-Native-Navigation V2](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/tree/v2) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)

## Usage
- Clone the repository locally,
- Run `npm install` in the root directory
- (optionally) Rename the project (using guides found online.)
  -  If you delete the `ios` and `android` folders as suggested by some guides, then you will need to follow the setup instructions found [here](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/tree/v2#installation).

## Folder structure
Based off blog posts and personal experience, I prefer keeping a single container with all it's related bits (i.e. reducer, actions, styles, etc.) in the same folder.  

This may seem overkil for small projects (and probably is), but the benefits are more obvious once your project is large (8+ containers).

Feel free to change the structure to suite your needs.

## Contributions
