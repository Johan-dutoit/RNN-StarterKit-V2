# RNN-StarterKit-V2
A starter kit for [React-Native-Navigation V2](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/tree/v2) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)

## Usage
Clone the repository locally and rename the projects as needed.

## Folder structure
Based off blog posts and personal experience, I prefer keeping a single container with all it's related bits (i.e. reducer, actions, styles, etc.) in the same folder.  

This may seem overkil for small projects (and probably is), but the benefits are more obvious once your project is large (8+ containers).

Feel free to change the structure to suite your needs.

## Contributions

Feel free to do pull requests if a certain feature you want is missing.  We accept all PR's that are enhancements to the project.
